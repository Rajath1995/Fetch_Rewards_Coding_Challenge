# Fetch_Rewards_Coding_Challenge. 

The Task: This challenge will focus on the similarity between two texts. Your objective is to write a program that takes as inputs two texts and uses a metric to determine
how similar they are. Documents that are exactly the same should get a score of 1, and documents that donâ€™t have any words in common should get a score of 0. Please use the 
samples below to develop your application.

This application takes two text strings as input and provides a value between 0 and 1
including the boundaries 0 being not similar and 1 being most similar or same. The values can
be between 0 to 1 (including boundaries 0 and 1) ex output could  be 0, 0.4, 0.7, 0.8, 1

Required Softwares : Python 3, Python IDE like Pycharm and packages like 1. math 2. string 3. flask. 4. pandas 5. numpy 

Steps to execute the Code. 

There is a video shared with steps on how to execute the above code and link to the video - 

Step 1: Download or clone the repository.
Step 2 : Open the repository in Pycharm IDE. 
Step 3: Create an python3 interpreter env in the main folder i.e. Fetch_Rewards_Coding_Challenge and install pacakages 1. math, 2. string 3. flask 4. Numpy and 5. Pandas by using the below command
pip install 
step 4: run the file app.py and click on the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ generated in the terminal. 
step 5: on the browser terminal there will be two text boxes where we can enter the texts or documents which we can compare the similarity between them. 
step 6: click on the get similarity button to get the value.
